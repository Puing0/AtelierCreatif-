# Aim of project 
This project was developed for learning purposes during AC classes with professor LARABI at **USTHB**.
the project idea is about creating a gesture recognition system for mute people using tiny machine learning knowledge acquired during the class.

# Requirements 
  - 2 Arduino nano 33 BLE with wires. <br />

  - Download the tensorflow Lite library for the arduino.

# How to use it ?

  - first, you need to install the Arduino IDE
  -Clone this repository, or you can just download the code.
  -Link the arduino board to your computer's USB port using the adequate wire.
  -Select the nano arduino as type of the board in the menu bar > Tools > Boards, or install the adequate board family if necessary.
  - Open the source code downloaded.
  -Compile the project by clicking on the tick on the top left.
  -Upload the code to the arduino board by pressing on the arrow next to the compiling button.
  -Move the arduino board, and see the results in the console.
  
 #### Note : 
 Client and server sketches must be uploaded to the two arduino, and both arduinos must be moved at the same time for the bluetooth connection.
